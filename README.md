# Rubiks-Cube-solver
a rubik's cube solver made using only string manipulation

# Description
- yet another simple project made for my intro to python course last year. This was made as a way to showcase that a computer could define "moves" in 3D space using only topics covered in the first 2 weeks of class.
- This does not use God's algorithm for the cube.
- The instructions are present within the comments of the code.
